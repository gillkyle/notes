Surely not everything can be the most important thing, but when people suggest that they are, it's interesting to find patterns.

Here are some notes I like that emphasize some principle in its utmost:

<Scripture
  title="Alma 36:21"

>
  21 Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my
  pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be{' '}
  <b>nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy</b>.
</Scripture>

<Scripture
  title="Alma 7:7"
  link="https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/scriptures/bofm/alma/7?id=p7&lang=eng#p7"
>
  7 For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold,{' '}
  <b>there is one thing which is of more importance than they all</b>â€”for behold, the time is not
  far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.
